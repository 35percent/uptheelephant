                    <h3>Affordable Housing</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey claims that providing the 17.5% social rented housing required by policy is not viable; instead it proposes 3% discounted market rent properties at 'around social rent levels'. Despite its new transparency policy the Council has refused to publish Delancey's viability assessment.</br> <a href="http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/#affordable-housing">Read more..</a></p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Its diverse economy of small retailers are at the heart of the community and make Elephant & Castle the vibrant destination it is. Delancey has made no provision for existing traders in its plans - the new shopping centre will contain only 5% affordable retail (in breach of 10% min policy requirement). Southwark should not be using its CPO powers to help Delancey evict them.</br><a href="http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/#what-about-existing-retailers">Read more..</a></p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey is turfing out the bingo hall and there will be no re-provision. It provides social activity for 7,500 local pensioners which use the facility every week. Southwark should not be using its CPO powers to evict the bingo hall without re-provision of community facilities for its pensioners. </br><a href="https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/demolition-elephant-castle-shopping-centre-bingo-hall-impact-bme-elderly-ladies-break-community/">Read more..</a><cp>

                    <h3>Offshore Elephant</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey is using a network of shell companies registered in tax havens including Bermuda, Panama and the British Virgin Islands, in order to avoid paying tax. Southwark should not be making planning policy concessions for developers who don't pay their tax.</br> <a href="http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/">Read more..</a></p>
