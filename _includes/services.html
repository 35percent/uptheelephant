                    <h3>Affordable Housing</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey claims that providing the full 17.5% social rented housing required by planning policy is not viable; its offer contains a shortfall of around 50 social rented homes, which it says would compromise its Â£137m protected profit margin if provided. Despite Southwark's new transparency policy, Delancey has failed to publish full viability assessment information.</br> <a href="http://35percent.org/2018-07-02-viability-and-delancey/#the-price-of-a-unit">Read more..</a></p>

                    <h3>Traders discarded</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Its diverse economy of small retailers are at the heart of the community and make Elephant & Castle the vibrant destination it is. Delancey has made no explicit provision for existing traders in its redeveloped centre and its temporary 'mini boxpark' provides woefully insufficient space.</br><a href="http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/#what-about-existing-retailers">Read more..</a></p>

                    <h3>Bingo Hall turfed out</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey is turfing out the bingo hall and bowling alley. Whilst there will be new 'leisure' space in the reprovided centre, there are no explicit plans to ensure that a bingo hall or bowling alley are retained. The bingo currently provides social activity for 7,500 local pensioners which use the facility every week. </br><a href="https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/demolition-elephant-castle-shopping-centre-bingo-hall-impact-bme-elderly-ladies-break-community/">Read more..</a><cp>

                    <h3>Offshore Elephant</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">Delancey is using a network of shell companies registered in tax havens including Bermuda, Panama and the British Virgin Islands, in order to avoid paying tax. Southwark should not be making planning policy concessions for developers who don't pay their tax.</br> <a href="http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/">Read more..</a></p>
