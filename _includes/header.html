            <h2>Save the Elephant from Delancey's destructive plans</h2>
	    <p>Help us save the Elephant & Castle's vibrant multicultural community from developer Delancey's destructive plans. The shopping centre is home to 130 small independent traders, most from Latin American and BME backgrounds. It is social hub for the Latin American community across London and beyond. The loss of their businesses and livelihoods will be a devastating blow to people who have worked hard over decades to build lives for themselves, creating a community that is now an integral part of the Elephant's identity.
		    </br>  If we don't act, then Delancey's plan (which envisages £137m profit) will result in a homogeneous string of chain stores and luxury flats, which are of no benefit to the existing community of traders, or local users of the centre for whom it provides affordable retail and leisure activities (bingo/bowling). We are crowdfunding to challenge Delancey's planning consent for the scheme via judicial review, We believe that Southwark has broken its own planning rules (not least on affordable housing requirements) and that it has not taken sufficient account of the detrimental impact the redevelopment will have on minority groups.
		    </br>
		    We need donations in order for this legal change to succeed - £10,000 is our initial target. If we reach this target, the money will go directly to the Lambeth Law Centre and will be used to pay legal fees, any expert witness costs and any associated legal costs. We will be represented pro-bono by Sarah Sackman of the Francis Taylor Building chambers.  Sarah won a recent landmark judicial review, quashing the approval for the redevelopment of Foxhill council estate in Bath. Our campaign also has the support of the Southwark Law Centre, many local councillors (names? link?) and Green Party co-leader Sian Berry. They recognise that this is a battle to put people first - ahead of the interests of property developers. By donating to our campaign you can help us in make London a city where people come first - before the profits of property developers.  All contributions, big or small will help in this crucial fight.</p>
