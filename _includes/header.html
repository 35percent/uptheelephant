            <h2>Save the Elephant from Delancey's destructive plans</h2>
	    <h3>Help us save the Elephant & Castle from Delancey's destructive plans for chain stores and luxury flats, which are of no benefit to the shopping centre's existing diverse community of traders and users. We are c** to c** Delancey's planning consent for the scheme on the basis that Southwark has broken its own planning rules and has not taken sufficient account of the detrimental impact the redevelopment will have on these minority groups.
		    </br>
		    We need d* in order for this l* c* to succeed. By donating to our campaign you can help us to make London a city where its diverse communities come first - before the profits of property developers.  All contributions, big or small will help in this crucial fight.</h3>
